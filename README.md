# Mock Customer Service API

This project was developed for an independent study course with Dr. Jianwei Niu at UTSA. It's a (very) simple RESTful API for a mock bank customer service system. It's built using Node, Hapi, and MongoDB. It's setup for Docker and Docker Compose. This project actually spans two repos with this repo acting as a kind of version 1. A more developed version is available [here](v2-repo).

## Features
- Account creation and login
- Auth using JWT
- Send messages between customer user and support user
- Send broadcast messages for all users to see
