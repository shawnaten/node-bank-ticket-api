# Mock Customer Service API

This is a project developed for an independent study course with Dr. Jianwei Niu at UTSA. It's a (very) simple RESTful API for a mock bank customer service system. This repo is actually version 1, it was evolved into a more developed version at [this repo](https://github.com/shawnmaten/node-message-api). This was my second project in Node and first project using Hapi.

## Features
- Auth using JWT
- Message between customer user and support user
- Send broadcast messages for all users to see
